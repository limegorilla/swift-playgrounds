# My Swift Playgrounds
 My comment-heavy exploration into the Swift coding language. Based on the Pluralsight course by Simon Allardice - [find that here](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/swift3-fundamentals/table-of-contents)

 You'll want to open these using either Xcode, or using Playgrounds (which is also available for iPad)
